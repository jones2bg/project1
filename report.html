    <h1>Report</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            You will create a website with a focused theme and audience of your choosing. Your site might serve a student group, a relative who’s planning a wedding, a business, or an artist who needs a portfolio. The site must serve someone besides yourself. A large part of web design is thinking empathetically, and this requirement makes that explicit.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I created this website for a student ministry that I am currently apart of.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your content must be original and not lifted from other websites. Third-party images are acceptable provided you adhere to their license.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    All of the content was taken from Facebook or Instagram.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. One of the files should be named index.html, which Apache loads by default.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each page has its own purpose, 5 in total.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your site must include some sort of header.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Every page has its own content header.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your site must include some sort of navigation links.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The whole site utilizes a navigation bar.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries. For instance, multicolumn layouts on large screens should be reduced to single column layouts on small screens.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each page supports mobile layouts and small screen layouts. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your site must maintain a coherent style across its pages. Repeated style rules must be placed in a shared external stylesheet. Style rules not shared between pages must be placed in separate external stylesheets.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The main established style is in my <code>style.css</code>.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to users of screen readers, user with images disabled, and webcrawlers.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The gallery utilizes alt attributes.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Each page must declare its favicon.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The whole site uses the same favicon for every page.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your site’s non-HTML resources must be organized. Images must be placed in a directory named images. CSS files must be placed in a directory named css. If you include any JavaScript code, these files must be placed in a directory named js.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Everything is folderized into the right folders.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your site must not be built using any libraries or frameworks. Do not use Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Angular, Vue, or any other third-party tools. You may, however, reimplement the ideas you see in these third-party tools.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    No 3rd party libraries or frameworks were used. Not even JavaScript.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the W3C’s Nu Validator (Links to an external site.).
            <ul>
                <li>
                    No warnings are thrown when validating.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            The content should be neatly aligned. The axes of alignment should be clearly visible. Favor left- and right-alignment over centering—as centering does not produce a strong axis of alignment.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Everything is aligned properly.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            The content should have adequate and consistent spacing. Text should never bleed against the edge of its containing box.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There is no overlap of text for each div.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font, and paragraph copy in a serif font.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I decided to use Montserrat which looks really good on websites.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your site must include at least one form. The form need not do anything at this point in your learning, but it must be present. Like all content, it must be neatly aligned.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I have a contact us form.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your site must include links to external sites.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I have one link to the facebook live.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your source code must be readable, using conventional and consistent formatting and meaningful names for classes and IDs. Favor kebab-case case identifiers over camelCase.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I tried to use the same naming conventions for everything.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>

            </ul>
